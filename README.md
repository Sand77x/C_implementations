A repo of any data structures or algorithms I want to implement in C.  
Each subdirectory here is a different project complete with its own Makefile (tested on MINGW / MSYS2 for windows).  
Each project also has unit tests that can be run using `make test`.

### Contents:
- Vector (cpp Vector class with some basic functions)
